            <p> Hi! Welcome to the #1 Dallas Cowboys fan...sorry i meant welcome to the portfolio of DeVante Bailey!
                here you will learn everything you need to know about me and my journey so far in coding. The most
                important thing about me as you can tell from the first sentence is my love for The Dallas Cowboys.
                Which is also the most stressful aspect of my life, but i still love them. But enough about them time to
                talk about the reason you're really here...ME!!!</p>

            <p> Im 26 years old and originally from Snow Camp, NC. Also known as "where???" where i grew up fishing and
                doing anything you could possibly do in the country. Sports were also a big part of my life hence the
                mentioning of the Dallas Cowboys every 5 seconds, but now that im older they've taken a backseat to my
                newfound and frustrating love for coding. This page was designed to show you what i've learned so far,
                so feel free to let me know what you think. </p>
